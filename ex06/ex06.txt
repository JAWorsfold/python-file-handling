Q) What happens if you try to open a file for reading that doesnâ€™t exist?

A)  File "ex06.py", line 1, in <module>
        infile = open('input.txt', 'r')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'input.txt'

Python is unable to find the file in question and raises a FileNotFoundError.
