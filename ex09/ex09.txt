Q) What is the difference between sequential access and random access?

A) I honestly couldn't see any mention of this in the notes or lecture slides.
I would assume the difference is that sequential access will access a file
sequentially, line by line, or however you have asked it to. Whereas random
access will access the file in a random place.
