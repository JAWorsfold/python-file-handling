Q) What happens if you try to move the file marker past the end of a file?
Try it out and report your results.

A) I was able to use file.seek(int) to move the position marker past the
previous end of the file. When I subsequently printed the file location with
file.tell(int) it told me that the position marker was at the new position
which previous had not existed. The file didn't change however as it was only
a read file.
