Q) What is the file marker? How do you move it? How do you determine its
current position? (Medium)

A) The file marker in python keeps track of your position when reading a file.
The file marker will move when reading the file, but you can also move it
manually. When reading you can move the line marker elsewhere with
file.seek(int) to find a specific place in the file. To find out the current
position you can use file.tell().
